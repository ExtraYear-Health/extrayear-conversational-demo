5. Here is the news article summary. Tell it to me. 
<newsArticle> In November, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft experienced a communication interruption that caused concern among its mission controllers. Despite the lack of data transmission, the spacecraft was still responsive to commands. After some investigation, the team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory identified that a malfunctioning chip was at the root of the problem, preventing access to essential parts of the spacecraft's memory. To address this, engineers devised a workaround by redistributing the affected code across different memory sections and updating the internal references. This solution was implemented in April 2024, and the spacecraft, now over 15 billion miles from Earth, successfully resumed sending back health and status data. Voyager 1 continues to study cosmic phenomena but is expected to cease operations and exit the Deep Space Network by 2036. </newsArticle>
