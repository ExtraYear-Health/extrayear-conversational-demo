Celebrating at the finish line, Lloyd received a Guinness World Records plaque and marked the occasion with enthusiastic dance moves. He impressively ran the first 14 miles without stopping, a personal best, and then alternated between walking and jogging for the remainder of the 26.4-mile course. His achievement was supported by his mother, Ceri Hooper, a former international track and field athlete for Wales, who provided extensive training and motivation.
