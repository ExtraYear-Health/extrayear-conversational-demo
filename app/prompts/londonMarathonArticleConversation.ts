His achievement was supported by his mother, Ceri Hooper, a former international track and field athlete for Wales, who provided extensive training and motivation. Lloyd's preparation included building strength and stamina through 5k races.

<newsArticle2>DonnaJean Wilde from Alberta has set a new world record for the longest abdominal plank, holding the position for 4 hours, 30 minutes, and 11 seconds. This achievement surpassed the previous record held by another Albertan named Dana. DonnaJean began using the plank exercise as a rehabilitation method after breaking her wrist about a decade ago and discovering it was effective for maintaining her fitness without straining her injury. Her family describes her exceptional dedication to fitness; she even planked while watching movies and studying for her master's degree. Despite suffering from transverse myelitis, a condition causing pain and numbness in the arms, hands, and shoulders, DonnaJean has adapted to manage the discomfort, which she credits as helping her endure the physical challenge of long-duration planking. Her record-setting effort is described as a dream come true.</newsArticle2>
